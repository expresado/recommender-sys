Now you're taking revenge, unless the city gets you first. Mob bosses need a favor, crooked cops need help, and street gangs want you dead. You'll have to rob, steal, and kill just to stay out of serious trouble. Anything can happen out here. Grand Theft Auto III features a fully 3-D living city, a combination of narrative-driven and nonlinear gameplay, and a completely open environment. Players are put at the heart of their very own gangster movie, in which anything can happen and probably will. With a cast of hundreds, 50-plus vehicles--including sports cars, ice-cream trucks, boats, and buses--three hours of music, (including opera, reggae, house, drum and bass, pop, and disco), a huge array of street-ready weapons, and some of the seediest characters in video game history, Grand Theft Auto III is a sprawling epic that will show you that sometimes crime can pay, and that sometimes it pays you back.\r\n","publisher":"Rockstar","published":"TBA","image":"http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/873525/article_post_gta3reviewanni.jpg","tags":"Action-Adventure;First-Person","platform":"Mobile","keywords":["youve","betrayed","left","dead","youre","taking","revenge","unless","city","gets","mob","bosses","need","favor","crooked","cops","help","street","gangs","want","youll","rob","steal","kill","stay","serious","trouble","happen","grand","theft","auto","iii","features","fully","living","combination","narrativedriven","nonlinear","gameplay","completely","open","environment","players","put","heart","gangster","movie","probably","cast","hundreds","vehiclesincluding","sports","cars","icecream","trucks","boats","busesthree","hours","music","including","opera","reggae","house","drum","bass","pop","disco","huge","array","streetready","weapons","seediest","characters","video","game","history","sprawling","epic","show","crime","pay","pays"]},{"game":"Temple Run 2","description":"\r\n\tThe sequel to the smash hit phenomenon that took the world by storm!

The first release in the Skylander series, Skylanders Spyro's Adventure Starter Pack contains three action figures, an exclusive game peripheral as well as other items. Action figures are compatible with all versions of the game. The game features co-op and competitive multiplayer, mini-games and more. The Skylanders Story For generations, the Skylanders -- a diverse group of mythical creatures, each with their own powers, personality and tendencies -- have used their magical powers, weapons and levelable battle skills to protect their homeland, the Skylands. But now, an evil tyrant with the powers of a portal master has frozen and banished them to Earth. Only you, a portal master yourself, can physically put Skylanders on the Portal of Power -- a conduit between this world and theirs -- and bring them back to life in their world where they can battle to save Skylands forever. Action Figures with Brains Skylanders are special physical action figures that come to life in-game. Just take a Skylander, place it on the included Portal of Power, which is synched to your game console and a representation of your chosen Skylander will come to life in the video game and do your bidding. There are over 30 Skylanders in total - each with unique abilities and powers (three are included in your starter pack). Skylander action figures remember their in-game experiences and upgrades as they explore the mysterious world of Skylands, battle menacing creatures and collect treasures. Conveniently, it doesn't matter what gaming system your friends have at their house, the Skylanders work on and across all major video game systems. That means that you can take your Skylanders over to your friend's house, drop them on their Portal of Power and your Skylanders will come to life in the game.\r\n","publisher":"Activision","image":"http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/869718/article_post_skylanderfeature.jpg","tags":"Action;Action-Adventure;Adventure","platform":"PC;Xbox 360;Wii;Playstation 3;Nintendo DS;Nintendo 3DS","keywords":["skylanders","spyros","adventure","actionadventure","game","spinoff","spyro","series","designed","younger","players","unlocks","new","universe","incorporating","unique","gameplay","mechanic","utilizing","physical","action","figures","synch","consoles","creating","controllable","ingame","representation","figure","release","skylander","starter","pack","contains","three","peripheral","items","compatible","versions","features","coop","competitive","multiplayer","minigames","story","generations","diverse","group","mythical","creatures","powers","personality","tendencies","used","magical","weapons","levelable","battle","skills","protect","homeland","skylands","evil","tyrant","portal","master","frozen","banished","earth","physically","put","power","conduit","world","theirs","bring","life","forever","brains","special","come","take","place","included","synched","console","chosen","video","bidding","total","abilities","remember","experiences","upgrades","explore","mysterious","menacing","collect","treasures","conveniently","doesnt","matter","gaming","system","friends","house","work","major","systems","means","drop"]},{"game":"The Lord of the Rings: War in the North","description":"\r\n\tLord of the Rings: War in the North├ö├Â─îÔöť├şis a co-op Action RPG, from the developers of├ö├Â─îÔöť├şBaldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, that immerses you and your friends in a brutal new chapter in the War of the Ring.

The new engine has been in development for a number of years and uses Kojima Production's renowned FOX Engine at its core, extended and enhanced to match the bespoke and complex demands of a football title. Based on six gameplay tenants, the new system allows every aspect of Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 to be totally reworked. Throwing off previous limitations imposed by dated animation systems and AI elements, the engine has enabled the PES Productions team to produce a game much closer to the excitement and variety of a top-level match. The central theme of fluidity is based on the constant moving of players and switching positions which mirrors the modern approach to football. Producers looked at how the matches ebb and flow, with player individuality key to a team's success, and well-drilled tactics helping underdogs produce giant-killing feats. Working from the ground up, the team has reworked every element of play, creating a fresh and energetic new standard for football titles. In addition to noticeably improved graphics and seamless animation, the thrust of the new engine's power has been used to redefine the way football is played on a gaming console. Gone are the limitations imposed by dated animation systems and AI elements, and instead PES 2014 boasts a central core that perfectly mimics the skill and awareness that elevates the world's greatest players above their peers.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t├ö├Â─îÔöť├ş\r\n","publisher":"Konami","published":"TBA","image":"http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1149933/article_post_PES_2014_screenshot.jpg","tags":"Sports","platform":"Playstation 3;Xbox 360","keywords":["pro","evolution","soccer","title","new","beginning","popular","series","allnew","engine","allowing","comprehensive","advance","inception","development","number","years","uses","kojima","productions","renowned","fox","core","extended","enhanced","match","bespoke","complex","demands","football","based","six","gameplay","tenants","system","allows","aspect","totally","reworked","throwing","previous","limitations","imposed","dated","animation","systems","elements","enabled","pes","team","produce","game","closer","excitement","variety","toplevel","central","theme","fluidity","constant","moving","players","switching","positions","mirrors","modern","approach","producers","looked","matches","ebb","flow","player","individuality","key","teams","success","welldrilled","tactics","helping","underdogs","giantkilling","feats","working","ground","element","play","creating","fresh","energetic","standard","titles","addition","noticeably","improved","graphics","seamless","thrust","engines","power","used","redefine","way","played","gaming","console","gone","instead","boasts","perfectly","mimics","skill","awareness","elevates","worlds","greatest","peers"]},{"game":"Attack of the Friday Monsters!

Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. He is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement. For DmC Capcom has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production values.
